## 🏛️ Company Vision

**Entertainment Games Soft (EGS)** is a private, non-typical gambling game development studio. We believe the future of the industry lies not in the "house edge," but in **technological transparency** and **the aesthetics of pure probability.**

* **Non-Profit Oriented**: Our goal is to explore the essence of gambling behavior through code rather than commercial gain.
* **Full-Stack Open Source**: From RNG (Random Number Generators) to backend engines, all our code is public on GitHub.
* **AI-Driven**: Exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) can predict trends or optimize the player interaction experience.

## 🧪 Research Focus

### 1. Discrete Probability & Fair Algorithms
We are committed to achieving true **Provably Fair** systems.
Using the $\text{HMAC-SHA256}$ algorithm, we ensure that the outcome of every round is determined before it starts and remains tamper-proof.

$$P(G) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

### 2. Large Language Models (LLM) & Psychology
We are researching how to leverage LLMs for:
* **Dynamic Narrative Generation**: Adjusting the visual storyline of slots in real-time based on the player's betting style.
* **Responsible Gambling Alerts**: AI-driven semantic warnings triggered automatically when irrational "loss-chasing" behavior is detected.

## 📊 Development Status

### ✅ Under Active Research...
* [x] **Open Source RNG Module**: Backend components passed NIST randomness tests.
* [x] **EazyUI Interface Integration**: All frontends are built on our proprietary **EazyUI Web Kit** and **HTML5** for a minimalist, fluid experience.
* [x] **Multi-Currency Settlement**: Supports virtual points and mainstream token simulation.

## 🛡️ Fair Play & Open Source (OSS)

**Why choose Open Source?**
The greatest crisis in the gambling industry is the "Black Box." EGS provides full code transparency, allowing anyone to audit our payout logic and random number algorithms at any time.

> "Code is Law, Probability is Truth."
