## 🏛️ Company Vision

**Entertainment Games Soft (EGS)** is a non-typical private gambling development studio intended to be established in Macau. We believe the future of the industry lies not in the "house edge" but in **technological transparency** and **the aesthetics of pure probability**.

* **Non-Profit Oriented**: Our mission is to explore the essence of gambling behavior through code and mathematical research.
* **Full-Stack Open Source**: From RNG (Random Number Generators) to backend engines, all source code is publicly available on GitHub for audit.
* **AI-Driven**: Pioneering the use of LLMs to predict gambling trends and optimize the player interaction experience.

## 🧪 Research Focus

### 1. Discrete Probability & Fair Algorithms
We are dedicated to achieving true **Provably Fair** systems. 
By utilizing the $\text{HMAC-SHA256}$ algorithm, we ensure that every game result is pre-determined and immutable before it is even generated.

$$P(G) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

### 2. Large Language Models (LLM) & Gambling Psychology
We are researching how to leverage LLMs for:
* **Dynamic Narrative Generation**: Adjusting visual storylines in real-time based on a player's betting style.
* **Responsible Gambling Alerts**: AI-driven semantic warnings triggered when irrational "loss-chasing" behavior is detected.

## 📊 Development Status

### ✅ Under Active Research...
* [x] **Open Source RNG Module**: Backend components verified via NIST randomness tests.
* [x] **EazyUI Interface Integration**: All frontends are built on our proprietary **EazyUI Web Kit** and **HTML5** for a minimalist, fluid experience.
* [x] **Multi-Currency Settlement**: Support for virtual points and mainstream token simulation logic.

## 🛡️ Fair Play & Open Source (OSS)

**Why do we choose Open Source?**
The greatest crisis in the gambling industry is "Black Box" operations. EGS solves this by making all code transparent, allowing anyone to verify our payout logic and random number algorithms at any time.

> "Code is Law, Probability is Truth."
